# XSnodes

A node is the building block for services (e.g. [services in Neptune](../../../../neptune/recipes/README.md)), which are a chain of nodes connected through a graph.
Nodes use a pub/sub model to communicate.
Each node may be run as a separate process.
It gets data, performs some operations, and then publishes to the next node, which may vary depending on the service.

Each node can take a dictionary of arguments so that the same node can execute differently in different contexts depending on the arguments.
Arguments are provided when the [GraphNode](grapher.py#L16) object is instantiated.
This dictionary can specify both instantiation time and run-time arguments for the node to use.
In addition, you can pass in run-time arguments when the node is [started](grapher.py#L34).
To do this, use the following structure for the args dictionary:

```python
args = {
    'node_1': {
        'add': {
            'key1': value,
            ...
        },
        'remove': {
            'key2': None,
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

It should be a dict with the node names as the top key. 
Each node dict can contain the _add_ and _remove_ keys, indicating which key/value pairs to add/update or which keys to remove, respectively, from the node args used during initialization.
If this dictionary is not present or contains unknown values, it is ignored.

## Writing New Nodes

The structure and methods of nodes are defined in [base.py](base.py).
Also refer exisitng nodes as needed for reference. 
Look at [ping.py](ping.py) as a simple example.
For such cases, the only required method a node must define is `loop()`.
A more complex example is [pre.py](pre.py), which opts to go for a more custom structure.
It does so by overriding the default `run()` method from the base class.

Rules:
* Node definitions must be placed in this folder in separate files.
The name of the file is used to name the node and is therefore unique.
* All new node classes that extend the base XstreamNode must be called Node
